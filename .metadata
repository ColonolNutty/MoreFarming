  "description" : "More farmables, more ingredients, more foods, more furnitures, new biomes, and a new way of cooking!\n\n[i]Installing this mod is a one-way trip, there are no uninstall instructions other than to start a new game. You have been warned![/i]\n\n[b]!!! IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ISSUE OF ANY KIND AND WANT IT FIXED FAST, I NEED YOUR HELP. SEE BELOW FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS !!!â€‹[/b]\n\nThanks, and enjoy the mod.\n\nSpice up your fridges with More Farming, includes EVERYTHING from Yes Chef (quests, recipes, appliances, etc.), so be sure to unsub from that one as soon as you can!\n\n[b][u]What Does This Mod Do?[/u][/b]\nThis mod is an update to TheBigBlueSerpent's MoreFoodMod and a continuation of More Farming by Mackinz, which added a ton of crops and a ton of different foods to the game. CN More Farming: Revitalization does the same, but in a more polished and developed way as well as creating any recipe you can dream up (I'm open to suggestions).\n\nThis mod adds almost 200 new meals, snacks, desserts and tons of other eatables, as well as 30+ new crops which can be found while adventuring among the stars or purchased at a local Terramart. On top of that, it also adds a multitude of appliances (Some available per race) which really fill out your kitchen. They aren't just decorations either, they are now a part of the cooking process! Have a vanilla blender lying around doing nothing but taking up space? BAM, it now has the ability to blend ingredients.\n\nIt doesn't just end at adding new ingredients or appliances, this mod also adds loads of recipes for using your new appliances. Ever wanted to bake a Pumpkin Pie? Well, now you can!\n\nThe intent of this mod is to match how cooking in real life works, if you know a recipe, why can't you just cook it? In this mod, there are no boundaries preventing cooking of a recipe, you know all recipes at the beginning, you just have to put together the ingredients!\n\n[i]It's even compatible with Frackin' Universe![/i]\n\nIf you'd like a more detailed (and prettier) description, a tutorial, and other neat stuff, check out the Chucklefish forums page at this link [url=http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/cn-more-farming-revitalization.4537]here[/url]\n \n[u]Addons[/u]:\n[list]\n[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=928896807]CN More Farming Frackin' Universe[/url]\n[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1222423828]Foodie's Furniture - More Farming Addon[/url]\n[/list]\n\n[u]Patches:[/u]\n[list]\n[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1182335072]CN More Farming Compact[/url]\n[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1182340106]CN More Farming Perennial[/url]\n[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1164999940]CN More Farming Perennial/Compact[/url]\n[/list]\n\n[u]Reporting Issues:[/u]\n\nAlways post your issues in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/927259833/1692662302104385318/]discussion tab[/url], the steam workshop, or in [url=https://github.com/ColonolNutty/MoreFarming/issues]github[/url].
