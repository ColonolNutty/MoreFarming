  "description" : "Spice up your fridges with More Farming!\n\nWhat Does This Mod Do?\nThis mod is an update to TheBigBlueSerpent's MoreFoodMod and a continuation of More Farming by Mackinz, which added a ton of crops and a ton of different foods to the game. CN More Farming: Revitalization does the same, but in a more polished and developed way - as you go harvesting crops and crafting new foods to eat, you'll uncover new recipes which you can use to create even more varieties of food. Ever wanted to eat a boiled artichoke or some scrambled eggs in Starbound? Well, now you can! It's even compatible with Frackin' Universe!\n\nThis mod adds almost 200 new consumable items to game, as well as 30+ new crops which you can purchase as seeds at the Terramart or find on your travels to new planets. On top of that, it also adds interesting new appliances to your available crafting stations, and also changes how you harvest a few of the vanilla crops.\n\nAt a later point in time, I hope to go over every aspect of the mod in detail, but I will start with the stores and go from there. (Almost everything below includes the original description, and as such, it may become outdated as aspects of the mod are updated to accommodate the latest version of starbound and beyond)\n\nIf you'd like a more detailed (and prettier) description check out the Chucklefish forums at this link here: http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/cn-more-farming-revitalization.4537/\n\nFAQ:\nQ: Where do I find the recipes?\nA: Craft a Recipe Book at the Kitchen Crafting Table and have a peek, it shows recipes whether you've learned them or not\n\nQ: Where do I find the Kitchen Crafting Table?\nA: You can craft this at the inventors table level 1\n\nQ: Is this compatible with X?\nA: Try it yourself, if it breaks, then let me know, otherwise everything is compatible\n\nQ: Can you implement X? Are you planning to implement X?\nA: Check out the github repository at the following link for plans in the making, if you don't see it, come back here and ask in the comments: https://github.com/ColonolNutty/MoreFarming/issues\n\nQ: I has a problem with the mod!\nA: I need your starbound.log (Without the number in the name) you can find it at this location on your computer \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Starbound\\storage\" (without the quotes), paste the contents of the file on pastebin.com and send me a link to the pastebin copy in the comments section below. Without this, most of your problems can't be solved. Better to list it and not need it, than to need it and not list it.\n\nQ: You don't has a Changelog!\nA: If you'd like to see changes made in a specific version, I'm trying to keep all the info in one place, here: https://github.com/ColonolNutty/MoreFarming/releases\n\nSpecial Thanks to: \n- TheBigBlueSerpent for the Original mod\n- Mackinz for updating it to Pleased Giraffe and for Rattan Crops\n- ColonolNutty, for updating it to v1.2.2 and the version you see now\n- Bughunter for Prickly Pears\n- Ulithium_Dragon for Animated Fly Trap\n- Petrenko for Bamboo (renamed Great Bamboo) and Cactus (renamed Saguaro)\n- Thundercraft for Holiday Fir Trees\n- CrispyBlockland for Crispy Food Crops and Crispy Food Stuffs\n- rosett for Farmable Fuels and Foods\n- Bestpick for More Foods\n- olaorman for Garpberries\n- steelndirt for Soybeans",
