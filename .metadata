UNTIL THE AUTHOR OF IMPROVED FOOD DESCRIPTIONS REALIZES HE BROKE HIS OWN DANG MOD, UNSUBSCRIBE FROM IT!! FROM NOW ON IF THIS IS REPORTED IN THE COMMENTS, I WILL REDIRECT YOU TO THIS ALERT.\n\n!!! IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ISSUE OF ANY KIND !!!\nI REQUIRE YOU TO PROVIDE YOUR LOGS AS STATED IN THE DESCRIPTION BELOW, I CANNOT AND WILL NOT HELP YOU IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE A LOG FILE AS STATED BELOW. IT MUST BE YOUR ENTIRE LOG FILE NOT THE PIECES YOU THINK ARE \"RELEVANT\"\n\nThanks, and enjoy the mod. :)\n\nSpice up your fridges with More Farming, includes EVERYTHING from Yes Chef (quests, recipes, appliances, etc.), so be sure to unsub from that one as soon as you can!\n\nWhat Does This Mod Do?\nThis mod is an update to TheBigBlueSerpent's MoreFoodMod and a continuation of More Farming by Mackinz, which added a ton of crops and a ton of different foods to the game. CN More Farming: Revitalization does the same, but in a more polished and developed way as well as creating any recipe you can dream up (I'm open to suggestions).\n\nThis mod adds almost 200 new meals, snacks, desserts and tons of other eatables, as well as 30+ new crops which can be found while adventuring among the stars or purchased at a local Terramart. On top of that, it also adds a multitude of appliances (Some available per race) which really fill out your kitchen. They aren't just decorations either, they are now a part of the cooking process! Have a vanilla blender lying around doing nothing but taking up space? BAM, it now has the ability to blend ingredients.\n\nIt doesn't just end at adding new ingredients or appliances, this mod also adds loads of recipes for using your new appliances. Ever wanted to bake a Pumpkin Pie? Well, now you can!\n\nThe intent of this mod is to match how cooking in real life works, if you know a recipe, why can't you just cook it? In this mod, there are no boundaries preventing cooking of a recipe, you know all recipes at the beginning, you just have to put together the ingredients!\n\nIt's even compatible with Frackin' Universe!\n\nIf you'd like a more detailed (and prettier) description, a tutorial, and other neat stuff check out the Chucklefish forums page at this link here: http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/cn-more-farming-revitalization.4537/\n\nFAQ:\nQ: Where do I find the recipes?\nA: Craft a Recipe Book at the Kitchen Crafting Table and have a peek, it shows all recipes that utilize the cooking system, whether you've learned them or not\n\nQ: Where do I find the Kitchen Crafting Table?\nA: You can craft this at the Inventors Table\n\nQ: Is this compatible with X?\nA: Try it yourself, if it breaks, then let me know, otherwise everything is compatible\n\nQ: Can you implement X? Are you planning to implement X?\nA: Check out the github repository at the following link for plans in the making, if you don't see it, come back here and ask in the comments: https://github.com/ColonolNutty/MoreFarming/issues\n\nQ: I has a problem with the mod!\nA: Firslty, describe the problem in the comments section below.\nSecond and preferrably in the same comment, I need your starbound.log (Without the number in the name)\n    you can find it at this location on your computer \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Starbound\\storage\" (without the quotes),\n    paste the contents of the file on pastebin.com and send me a link to the pastebin copy in the comments section below.\n    Without this, your problem will be ignored and I will refuse to help you.\n\nQ: You don't has a Changelog!\nA: If you'd like to see changes made in a specific version, I'm trying to keep all the info in one place, here: https://github.com/ColonolNutty/MoreFarming/releases\n\nSpecial Thanks to: \n- JaseofBase for the original Yes Chef mod\n- TheBigBlueSerpent for the Original mod\n- Mackinz for updating it to Pleased Giraffe and for Rattan Crops\n- rare_candy_bracelet for making a large portion of the images of objects, items, etc.\n- ColonolNutty, for updating it to v1.2.2 and the version you see now, as well as including Yes Chef into this.\n- Bughunter for Prickly Pears\n- Ulithium_Dragon for Animated Fly Trap\n- Petrenko for Bamboo (renamed Great Bamboo) and Cactus (renamed Saguaro)\n- Thundercraft for Holiday Fir Trees\n- CrispyBlockland for Crispy Food Crops and Crispy Food Stuffs\n- rosett for Farmable Fuels and Foods\n- Bestpick for More Foods\n- olaorman for Garpberries\n- steelndirt for Soybeans\n- MtgVoryo for Eggplant and Coconut Palm\n- DoomFire for Underground Chocolate Biome\n- LunaOculi for Underground Chocolate Biome Art\n\nSpecial Thanks (Offered Suggestions and provided feedback, if I missed you, speak up!):\n- Revvemup\n- STRIKER",
