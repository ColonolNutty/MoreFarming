IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ISSUE OF ANY KIND AND WANT IT FIXED FAST, I NEED YOUR LOGS. SEE BELOW FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS !!!â€‹\n\nThanks, and enjoy the mod. :)\n\nSpice up your fridges with More Farming, includes EVERYTHING from Yes Chef (quests, recipes, appliances, etc.), so be sure to unsub from that one as soon as you can!\n\nWhat Does This Mod Do?\nThis mod is an update to TheBigBlueSerpent's MoreFoodMod and a continuation of More Farming by Mackinz, which added a ton of crops and a ton of different foods to the game. CN More Farming: Revitalization does the same, but in a more polished and developed way as well as creating any recipe you can dream up (I'm open to suggestions).\n\nThis mod adds almost 200 new meals, snacks, desserts and tons of other eatables, as well as 30+ new crops which can be found while adventuring among the stars or purchased at a local Terramart. On top of that, it also adds a multitude of appliances (Some available per race) which really fill out your kitchen. They aren't just decorations either, they are now a part of the cooking process! Have a vanilla blender lying around doing nothing but taking up space? BAM, it now has the ability to blend ingredients.\n\nIt doesn't just end at adding new ingredients or appliances, this mod also adds loads of recipes for using your new appliances. Ever wanted to bake a Pumpkin Pie? Well, now you can!\n\nThe intent of this mod is to match how cooking in real life works, if you know a recipe, why can't you just cook it? In this mod, there are no boundaries preventing cooking of a recipe, you know all recipes at the beginning, you just have to put together the ingredients!\n\nIt's even compatible with Frackin' Universe!\n\nIf you'd like a more detailed (and prettier) description, a tutorial, and other neat stuff check out the Chucklefish forums page at this link here: http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/cn-more-farming-revitalization.4537/\n\n\nReporting Issues:\n\nAlways post your issues in the DISCUSSION THREAD, the STEAM WORKSHOP COMMENTS SECTION, or in GITHUB, NOT IN THE REVIEWS, these types of reviews WILL BE REPORTED. I am very attentive, and I will always respond to an issue posted in any of these places (I get emails when you do it in GitHub).\n\nGAME CRASHES: I WILL need to see your log file before I can help you. Capisce?\n\nHow to I get the logs though??!\n\n1. Locate the log file here (There should be no number in the name, this means a file with the name \"starbound.log.1\" is NOT the CORRECT file):\n- \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Starbound\\storage\\starbound\"\n- if you have file extensions enabled \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Starbound\\storage\\starbound.log\"\n2. Paste the contents on www.pastebin.com\n3. Copy the URL/Address at the top of your browser\n4. Add a comment in the discussion tab, steam workshop, or github, and paste the URL/Address you copied\n5. Without this, your problem will be ignored and I will refuse to help until you provide the above to me.\n\nOther Issues:\nIf your issue is not crash-related, but something more along the lines of \"this can't be crafted\" or \"I get Perfectly Generic Items from <insert some action here>\" or any number of issues you may face, see below:\n\n\"This can't be crafted\"\n1. Launch Starbound\n2. In-game, open the appliance you are crafting with\n3. Check the \"Enable Debug\" checkbox\n4. Attempt to craft the item that you can't craft\n5. If using the FU addon, place the ingredients for the recipe\n6. If not using the FU addon, place the ingredients for the recipe and click the Make/Go/Cook button\n7. Exit Starbound\n8. Continue by following the same steps as above for \"How to I get the logs though??!\"\n\n\"I get PGIs from <insert some action here>\"\n1. Launch Starbound\n2. In-game, do that action, whatever it is, harvesting/killing/fishing/dancing\n3. Exit Starbound\n4. Continue by following the same steps as above for \"How to I get the logs though??!\"\n\nSuggestions:\n\nPlease leave suggestions in the Discussion thread, on the Steam workshop page, or log an issue in the GitHub repository. I will respond to them with my thoughts, possible alternatives, or any other things that come to mind. I don't turn down good ideas.\n\nFAQ:\nQ: Where do I find the recipes?\nA: Craft a Recipe Book at the Kitchen Crafting Table and have a peek, it shows all recipes that utilize the cooking system, whether you've learned them or not\n\nQ: Where do I find the Kitchen Crafting Table?\nA: You can craft this at the Inventors Table\n\nQ: Is this compatible with X?\nA: Try it yourself, if it breaks, then let me know, otherwise everything is compatible\n\nQ: Can you implement X?
