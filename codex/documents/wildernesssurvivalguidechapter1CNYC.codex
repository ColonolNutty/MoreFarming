"^blue;Introduction:^white;
So, you fancy yourself a wilderness survivalist? A culinary specialist? An iron chef? Whatever the case, you've a long road ahead of you. This guide will introduce you to the basics of cooking. Some basic wilderness survival techniques are also listed here

Detailed within this chapter is the process of making ^green;Bread^white; from scratch.",
 
"^blue;Grinding for Flour:^white; 
To start, you will need to craft a ^orange;Camp Millstone^white;
Once crafted, you will need to obtain one of the following:
^green;Wheat^white;
^green;Potato^white;
^green;Whole Oats^white;
^green;Rice^white;

Once found, place the item(s) within the ^orange;Camp Millstone^white; to produce ^green;Flour^white;.",

"^red;WARNING: Place only one type of item at a time, any more and you won't get what you expect, this warning applies to all cooking methods
A visual example:
Any Number of Potatoes = Flour
Any Number of Wheat = Flour
Any Number of Potatoes + Any Number of Wheat = Nothing (Or a recipe, if one exists)^white;",

"^blue;Acquiring Water:^white;
Now that you have Flour, you should begin searching for ^green;Water^white;.
If water cannot be obtained through normal means there is an alternative, by boiling ^green;Mud^white;.

The boiling process requires the use of a ^orange;Camp Cookpot^white; or other boiling apparatus.
This can be made by hand by combining ^orange;Logs^white; and ^green;Copper Ore^white;.",

"^blue;Boiling Mud:^white;
Once the ^orange;Camp Cookpot^white; is crafted and ^green;Mud^white; is acquired, place the mud within the ^orange;Camp Cookpot^white; and boil thoroughly to obtain ^green;Water^white;.",

"^blue;Mixing for Bread:^white;
Now that both ^green;Flour^white; and ^green;Water^white; have been acquired, they must be mixed.
^green;Dough^white; can be made just using your hands, but more advanced recipes must be done with a blender or other means, this is detailed in later chapters.

^orange;Dough Recipe:^white;
1 ^green;Flour^white;
1 ^green;Water^white;",

"^blue;Makeshift Oven:^white;
With the ^green;Dough^white; in hand you will need an oven to bake it in.
To make a ^orange;Camp Oven^white; you will need ^green;Cobblestone^white; and ^green;Wood^white;.
Once materials are acquired, put them together using your hands.",

"^blue;Bread in the Oven:^white;
Now place the ^green;Dough^white; within the ^orange;Camp Oven^white; and wait for your delicious ^green;Bread^white;.",

"^blue;More to come:^white;
Now that you know how to make ^green;Bread^white;, seek out other chapters for information on more advanced techniques, they will likely become available over time from your local ^orange;Terramart^white;."
