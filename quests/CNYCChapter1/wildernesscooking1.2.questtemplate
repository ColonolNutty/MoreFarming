Once I find one of those, I should place them in the ^orange;Camp Millstones^white; to make some ^green;Flour^white;. Seems simple enough. Wait, there's also a warning here: 'Place only one type of item for grinding at a time, any more and you won't get what you expect'. Hmm, I wonder if the warning is just when making ^green;Flour^white;? I'll have to experiment to find out",
